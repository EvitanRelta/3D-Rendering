# 3D-Rendering

My first project thats posted onto GitHub.<br/>
This is a proof-of-concept project that aims to render 3D objects in WinForm using the DrawPolygon method in System.Drawing.Graphics, and allow the user to fly around in the 3D world.<br/>
Currently it uses triangle-mesh rendering, with future plans to test a 4-sided-polygon-mesh instead to better make cubes (1 polygon per side of cube instead of 2 triangles); and then to generate a landscape of cubes like in Minecraft.
